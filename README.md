# Nilo
Nilo is an IOS app built with Swift, Xcode and Firebase as a backend. Nilo offers a platform for students studying in Washington and Lee to 
find travel buddies, get informed about events happening on Campus, find dining buddies, and give away extra swipes to connect with students within the W&L community. 

Nilo grew from a small idea of sharing extra swipes into the much bigger application it is today. Every year Washington
and Lee first-year students are given 25 swipes per week that they cannot opt out of. The majority of students do not end up using the entire 25 
swipes given and ... you guessed it right! it resets on Friday night and goes away! Meanwhile, upperclassmen are either out of swipes every time 
because they either reduced their swipe down to 15 per week or 7 swipes per week because simply they can. Hence, We created this app to 
connect first-year students with Upper-class students. Freshmen can offer a meal with their extra swipes they are not using to any upperclassmen 
and leverage it to network and make friends. 
Washington and Lee University is located in a small town and there isn’t any public transportation available. The
only service in and out of the town is either via a private vehicle or via the university shuttle service provided only
during the academic breaks. Some of the students have cars and some don’t, so I decided to create a platform
where students with cars can post where they are going and when. The notice will be shown to the community
and other students can sign up if they are sharing partial or pull travelling routes.

Nilo uses Firebase as a backend service, and uses different features offered by Firebase such as Storage, Cloud Firestore database, Authentication, 
and Analytics.
