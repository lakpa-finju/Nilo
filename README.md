# first-swift-project ( Nilo) 
Nilo is an IOS app build with swift, Xcode and firebase as a backend. Nilo offers a platform for students studying in Washington and Lee to 
find travel buddies, get informed about events happenign on Campus, find dining buddies, and an opportunity to give away swipes that they
are not using to connect with students within W&L community. 

Nilo grew from a small idea of sharing extra swipes first year studets have into a much bigger application it is today. Every year Washington
and Lee first year students are given a 25 swipes per week that they canot opt out of. Majority of students do not end up using the entire 25 
swipes given and ... you guessed it right! it resets on Friday night and goes way! Meanwhile, Upperclass are either out of swipes every time 
becaseu they reduced either reduced their swipe down to 15 per week or 7 swipes per week because simply they can. Hence, We created this app to 
connect first year student with Upper classmen studets. Freshment can offer a meal with their extra swipes they are not using to any upper classmen 
and leverage it to network and make friends. 

Nilo uses firebase as a backend service, and uses different features offered by firebase such as Storage, Cloud firestore database, Authentication, 
and Analytics.
